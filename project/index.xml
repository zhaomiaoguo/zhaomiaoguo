      <title>Agnet-base Simulation for Complext Infratructure Systems</title>

      <description>Due to increasing connectivities, interdependencies, and complexities of infrastructure systems, an analytical model may not be feasible to reflect the interactions within/between systems. As an alternative, agent-base modeling is found to be effective to capture complicated agent interactions and visualize system dynamics, especially with increasing data availability. This project developes an agent-base modeling platform to capture the interactions between key decision makers in transportation and power systems, including drivers, households and infrastructure investors, and simulate their decision making over both short-term and long-term horizon. This platform has broad applications in the study of EV charging, ride-sharing and power-transportation interdependency.</description>

      <description>Cascading failures have become one of the biggest challenges for increasingly connected infrastructure systems, such as power network. This project investigates effective and robust planning and operation strategies for power system considering the possibility of cascading failures.</description>

      <title>Charging Infrastructure Evolvement in a Competitive Market</title>
      <link>https://zhaomiaoguo.github.io/project/evolvement_charging/</link>

      <description>Charging infrastructure is a critical element for the success of transportation electrification. But charging infrastructure is not developed by a single central planner. This project investigates the potential evolvement of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_electric_vehicle&#34; title=&#34;Plug-in Electric Vehicle&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PEV&lt;/a&gt; charging infrastructure in a competitive market.</description>

      <title>Data Analytics in Transportation System</title>
      <link>https://zhaomiaoguo.github.io/project/data_analytics/</link>

      <description>Data has arguably become one of the most powerful tools to understand system in a timely fashion. In transportation, multiple data sources (e.g. social media, transaction, economics, sensors, etc.) have become readily available. This project collects and analyzes large-scale transportation data, including vehicle market value, on-demand transportaiton service, travel survey, and charging data.</description>
